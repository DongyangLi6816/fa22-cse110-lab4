1. 20 will be printed since add is true and num1 = 10 and num2 = 10. result will be 20.
2. 20 will be printed since var varible can be access within the funtion scope. Thus result will still be 20.
3. 20 will be printed since add is true and num1 = 10 and num2 = 10. result will be 20.
4. The code returns an error. The reason is that let varible result is declared inside the if block and has block scope, which means it is not accessible outside of the block it is defined in.
5. The code will returns an error. Since we declared result as a constant value. We cannot reassign it to another value.
6. If the above code is correct, the code will returns an error since const result is declared inside the if block and has block scope, which means it is not accessible outside of the block it is defined in.
